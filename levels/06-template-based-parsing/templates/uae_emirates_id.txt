- "Identity Card" or "بطاقة هوية" text
- ID Number starting with "784-"
- Name in both English and Arabic
- Nationality information
- Photo of the card holder
- UAE flag or emblem

Extract ALL available information from this document and return it in the following JSON format:

{
  "id_number": "string (784-YYYY-XXXXXXX-X format)",
  "full_name": "string (full name in English)",
  "full_name_arabic": "string (full name in Arabic if visible)",
  "nationality": "string",

  "issue_date": "string (DD/MM/YYYY format)",
  "expiry_date": "string (DD/MM/YYYY format)",
  "card_number": "string (if different from ID number)"
}
